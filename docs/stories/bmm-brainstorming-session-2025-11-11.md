# BMM Brainstorming Session

**Date:** November 11, 2025

**Participants:**
*   BIP (User)
*   Carson (Elite Brainstorming Specialist)

## Brainstorming Topic: How to improve the "AI CV & Job Application Assistant" program

### Main Idea: "CV Strength" Meter

A visual "CV strength" meter that fills up as the user improves their CV, providing immediate, visual feedback to keep the user motivated.

### How AI can be used to power the "CV Strength" Meter

The "CV strength" meter will be a composite score made up of several key dimensions, each powered by AI:

**1. Relevance to Job Ad (Semantic Matching):**
*   **How AI is used:** Use AI models like `text-embedding-3-small` to create a "semantic fingerprint" of both the user's CV and the job description. By comparing these fingerprints, we can get a precise score on how well the CV's content aligns with the job's requirements.

**2. Keyword Optimization (NLP):**
*   **How AI is used:** Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the key skills and requirements from the job description and then check if they are present in the user's CV.

**3. Action Verb Usage (NLP):**
*   **How AI is used:** Train an NLP model to recognize and count the number of strong action verbs at the beginning of each bullet point in the user's experience section.

**4. Quantifiable Results (NLP and Pattern Matching):**
*   **How AI is used:** Use a combination of NLP and pattern matching to detect the presence of numbers, percentages, and other metrics that demonstrate the impact of the user's work.

**5. Clarity and Readability (Language Models):**
*   **How AI is used:** Use a powerful language model (like GPT-4) to assess the clarity, conciseness, and overall readability of the CV's text. It can even check for grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.

By combining the scores from these different dimensions, we can create a single, comprehensive "CV strength" score that gives the user a clear idea of where they stand and, more importantly, what they need to do to improve.
