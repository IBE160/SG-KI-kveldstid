## Brainstorming Topic: User Accounts and Profile Management

### Main Idea: Robust Profile Management for Personalized Experience

Comprehensive user accounts and profile management are foundational for delivering a personalized, persistent, and evolving experience, crucial for features like "CV strength" meter, "Career Path" Simulator, and "AI Mentor Mode."

### Proposed User Accounts and Profile Management Functionality:

**1. Secure Authentication & Access:**
*   **Standard Methods:** Secure email/password authentication, potentially with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
*   **Social Logins:** Integration with popular platforms like Google or LinkedIn for convenience.
*   **Personal Dashboard:** A central hub for all career development activities upon login.

**2. Comprehensive CV & Document Management:**
*   **Multiple CV Versions:** Ability to upload and store various tailored CVs.
*   **Job Ad Library:** A repository for all analyzed job ads.
*   **Generated Content Archive:** Storage for all tailored cover letters, rewritten bullet points, and analysis reports.

**3. Application History & Learning Log:**
*   **Automated Tracking:** Logging of all job application events, including CV used, job ad, generated outputs, and AI analysis.
*   **Learning & Skill Acquisition Log:** Tracks completion of courses, projects, and new skill acquisition.

**4. Dynamic Skill Inventory:**
*   **AI-Extracted Skills:** Continuous extraction and maintenance of a dynamic inventory of user skills from CVs, projects, and learning logs.
*   **Skill Proficiency:** User self-assessment and AI inference of proficiency.
*   **Skill Gaps Visualization:** Feeds into "CV strength" meter and "Career Path" Simulator.

**5. Career Goals & Preferences:**
*   **Defined Aspirations:** Users can state short-term/long-term career goals, target industries, roles, and company cultures.
*   **Learning Preferences:** Information on preferred learning styles, time availability, and budget for courses.

**6. Data Privacy & Control:**
*   **Transparent Policies:** Clear and accessible privacy policies.
*   **User Controls:** Granular control over data (view, edit, download, delete).

### Technical Considerations:
*   Requires a robust database for data persistence, integrity, and efficient retrieval.

This comprehensive profile management transforms the tool from a one-off utility into a continuous, evolving partner in a student's career journey.
