**Date:** November 11, 2025

**Participants:**

*   Carson (Elite Brainstorming Specialist)

## Brainstorming Topic: First-Time User Experience (Onboarding)

### Main Idea: Engaging and Value-Driven Onboarding

A smooth and engaging onboarding experience is crucial for user adoption and retention, designed to be an exciting and value-driven introduction to the tool.

### Proposed Onboarding Flow:

**Step 1: The "Welcome" Screen & The Promise of Value**
*   Clean, visually appealing welcome screen with a clear and compelling value proposition.
*   Prominent call-to-action: "See How It Works (in 60 seconds)".

**Step 2: The "Interactive Demo" or "Guided First Run"**
*   Launches an interactive demo with a pre-loaded sample CV and job ad.
*   Guides the user through a simulated analysis, highlighting key features and benefits with animated tooltips and concise explanations.
*   Allows the user to experience the "magic" of the tool without immediate data upload.

**Step 3: The "Profile Setup" Wizard & The First Personalization**
*   Call-to-action: "Ready to try it with your own CV?".
*   Simple, two-step profile setup wizard:
    1.  "What's your career goal?" (for personalization).
    2.  "Upload your CV." (triggers preliminary analysis and initial "CV strength" score).

**Step 4: The "Dashboard" Introduction & The "First Win"**
*   User is taken to their personal dashboard, celebrating their "first win" (initial CV strength score).
*   Uses a "hotspot" tour to introduce key dashboard features:
    *   "CV strength" meter.
    *   Job ad upload for detailed analysis.
    *   "Career Path" simulator.

**Step 5: The First Real Analysis**
*   Concludes by prompting the user to start their first real analysis: "Ready to land your dream job? Paste a job ad here to get started."

### Design Principles for Onboarding:
*   **Value-focused:** Every step demonstrates how the tool helps achieve user goals.
*   **Interactive and engaging:** Avoid passive tutorials; use interactive elements.
*   **Personalized:** Tailor the experience based on user-provided information.
*   **Optional and skippable:** Allow experienced users to bypass onboarding.

This approach aims to be engaging, value-driven, and to get the user to their "aha!" moment as quickly as possible.
