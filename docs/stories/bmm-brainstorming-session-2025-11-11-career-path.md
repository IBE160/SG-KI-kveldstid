## Brainstorming Topic: How the "Career Path" Simulator would function

### Main Idea: "Career Path" Simulator

A personalized career coach for students, guiding them from their current state to their desired future role by identifying gaps and providing an actionable roadmap.

### How the "Career Path" Simulator would function:

**Step 1: The User's Goal**
The user provides their current CV and their desired future job title (e.g., "Senior Data Scientist", "Product Manager", "Lead UX Designer").

**Step 2: AI-Powered Job Market Analysis**
*   The AI would analyze the job market in real-time by scanning job postings for the desired role.
*   It would build a comprehensive "profile" of the target role, including:
    *   Most commonly required skills (technical and soft).
    *   Typical years of experience needed.
    *   Common educational backgrounds and certifications.
    *   Key responsibilities and achievements.

**Step 3: AI-Powered Gap Analysis**
*   The AI would compare the user's current CV with the "profile" of the target role.
*   It would use semantic analysis to identify key gaps in:
    *   **Skill Gaps:** Specific skills the user is missing.
    *   **Experience Gaps:** Types of experience the user lacks.
    *   **Education/Certification Gaps:** Required degrees or certifications the user doesn't have.

**Step 4: Personalized Roadmap Generation**
*   Based on the gap analysis, the AI would generate a personalized, step-by-step "career path". This roadmap would include:
    *   **Skills to acquire:** Recommendations for online courses, certifications, or open-source projects.
    *   **Experience to gain:** Suggestions for personal projects, internships, or volunteer opportunities.
    *   **Networking suggestions:** Recommendations for industry events, online communities, or key people to follow.

**Step 5: Interactive Visualization and Progress Tracking**
*   The career path would be presented as an interactive timeline or a skill tree.
*   Users can mark steps as "in progress" or "completed".
*   The system would provide regular reminders and encouragement.
*   A "progress bar" would visualize the user's advancement towards their career goals.
