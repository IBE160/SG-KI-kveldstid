AI CV & Job Application Assistant (Student-Focused) 

Background 

Students often apply to internships and entry-level roles using generic CVs and cover letters that fail to pass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and do not address key job requirements. This project demonstrates how AI can help students tailor their applications, identify missing qualifications, and understand how AI is used in modern recruiting workflows. 

Purpose 

Create a web-based AI assistant that takes a student’s CV and a specific job ad as input and produces: 
- A tailored cover letter in a professional tone 
- CV improvement suggestions and bullet rewrites 
- A gap analysis highlighting missing or partial matches 
- ATS optimization tips (keywords, structure, and metrics) 

Target Users 

- Primary: Students and recent graduates applying for internships or entry-level positions 
- Secondary: Career advisors and general job seekers (optional extensions) 

Core Functionality 

**Must Have (MVP)** 
- Upload CV (PDF/DOCX/TXT) → Extract structured text and skills using Unstructured.io or PyMuPDF 
- Paste job ad → Extract must-have/nice-to-have requirements and keywords 
- Semantic matching between CV and job ad using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small 
- Generate tailored cover letter and CV bullet rewrites via GPT-4-turbo (low temperature, no fabrication) 
- Display a gap table (match / partial / missing) with evidence pointers 
- Provide simple ATS optimization feedback (keyword density, formatting, action verbs) 
- Export results to Markdown (DOCX/PDF as stretch goals) 
 
**Nice to Have (Optional Extensions)** 
- Multi-agent recruiter panel for explainable subscores 
- Interview question generator based on must-have gaps 
- Bias auditor to flag gendered or exclusionary phrasing 
- Tone mimicry from sample texts and ATS simulator 

Technical Architecture 

- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS (responsive and accessible UI) 
- Backend: Python FastAPI serving REST endpoints for parsing, analysis, and generation 
- AI Components: OpenAI API for embeddings and text generation 
- Document Parsing: Unstructured.io or PyMuPDF for PDF, python-docx for DOCX, plain text as baseline 
- Export: python-docx (DOCX), reportlab/weasyprint (PDF), Markdown for MVP 
- Database: Stateless for MVP (no persistence). If extended, use SQLite or PostgreSQL with schema for User, CV, JobAd, Analysis, and GeneratedContent 

Data Requirements 

- User: name, email, preferences, consent 
- CV: raw text, sections, extracted skills 
- Job Ad: role, company, requirements, keywords 
- Analysis: match scores, gap list, ATS score 
- Generated Content: cover letter, rewritten bullets, export type 

Claim-to-Evidence Validation 

All generated claims must be supported by CV evidence through: 
- Step 1: Regex and keyword matching 
- Step 2: Embedding-based semantic similarity verification 

ATS Optimization Methodology 

- Keyword density between job ad and CV 
- Action verb presence (achieved, implemented, designed) 
- Quantification rate (numbers, metrics, results) 
- Section structure (Education, Experience, Skills) 
- File format and layout compatibility 

Timeline & Milestones (6 Weeks) 

- Week 1: Project setup, document parsing prototype, basic UI 
- Week 2: CV/job ad extraction and structured data model 
- Week 3: Semantic matching and gap analysis implementation 
- Week 4: Cover letter generation and claim validation 
- Week 5: ATS optimization module, export functionality, testing 
- Week 6: Integration testing, UI refinement, documentation, demo 

Risk Assessment & Mitigation 

- Scope Creep: Focus strictly on MVP, postpone optional features 
- Parsing Complexity: Start with text-only CVs, add PDF/DOCX later 
- AI Inaccuracy: Use dual validation (regex + embeddings) 
- Time Constraints: Iterative weekly milestones with review points 

Out of Scope 

- Visual CV design or templates 
- LinkedIn integration or profile generation 
- Salary negotiation or job-matching tools 
- Persistent cloud data storage (MVP is local and stateless) 
- Multi-language support (English only in MVP) 

User Stories 

1. As a student, I can upload my CV and a job ad to receive a tailored cover letter. 
   - Acceptance: The cover letter includes ≥80% of must-have requirements. 
2. As a student, I can view a gap table showing matched, partial, and missing requirements. 
   - Acceptance: Gaps are correctly categorized and evidence-linked. 
3. As a student, I can receive rewritten CV bullet suggestions that improve ATS readability. 
   - Acceptance: Each rewrite uses action verbs and quantifiable results. 
4. As a student, I can export the generated content for use in real applications. 
   - Acceptance: Output is downloadable and correctly formatted (Markdown baseline). 

Success Criteria 

- ≥80% of must-have requirements addressed in generated letter 
- ≥95% of claims verifiable through CV evidence 
- ≥15pp ATS improvement over baseline CV 
- ≤5 minutes end-to-end generation time 

Conclusion 

This improved project proposal provides a technically grounded, feasible, and student-focused AI application. By combining precise NLP parsing, semantic analysis, and validated text generation, the assistant empowers students to craft stronger, evidence-based job applications while learning how AI enhances modern recruitment processes.
